A design system is a necessary tool to create cohesive and coherent experiences across a variety of platforms and use cases, efficiently and consistently. A good system provides insight into the company's design priorities and principles, and provides designers and developers with a well-documented library of robust and reusable components.

Currently several teams have design system initiatives on their radar, but none stepped up yet to also take on the cross-team standarizing and documenting required for a design system. It's not unlike freight train companies that need the tracks but lack the expertise to build the entire track system, if they could even agree on standards that would allow them all to share the tracks.

For context: The website's design continutes to evolve, and only recently has it tackled atomic-level "design token" elements. Like Digital, Bridge's design is defined in its output. Modern Ops is currently struggling with converting its Carbon-based theme into Bridge; the two systems aren't aligned, and Bridge's documentation hasn't moved beyond boilerplate yet.

Additionally, Digital is locked into technologies that aren't widespread yet, so its focus is mostly on elements no other teams could or would share. Bridge's use of an external firm risks siloing it for different reasons. (After all, one can hardly blame those paying for the banquet to be reluctant to let others decide the menu.) Left unchecked, we risk a series of fractured and overly-specific systems that may be unusable by, or even inaccessible to, other teams in Kyndryl.

Lastly, strong design systems all have something in common: a community's support. A design system is a complex living document that must satisfy a diverse userbase, but it does more than simply provide visuals and code examples. It should also provide insight into the system's rationale on topics like accessibility, design patterns, and data visualization. A successful implementation requires designer, developer, and user voices from across the company who can lend their expertise and experience into building a solid system. This community support is the key to creating a robust system rigorous enough to maintain a consistent experience across differing uses, but flexible enough to be a complete solution for those uses, too.

Conclusion

The design system should live within and be led by Design Strategy as the centralized point, with a focal point who will marshal and enable teams' involvement. This dedicated focal point will have (and share!) cross-team insights, identify and prioritize design elements for the system, and work with teams to standardize and contribute the elements that team has built -- and then to document all of it in a centralized location for other teams to access, understand, and use.
