			"In my role as the executive sponsor for the data science profession at Kyndryl, she and I collaborated on visualization standards. KL brought a depth of knowledge to this topic that made the end product more compelling than I reasonably could have hoped. She was able to blend respect for brand colors with empathy for accessibility needs in a way that enabled the definition of multiple palettes that were brand adjacent and visible to any potential member of the audience.",
			"During the development, we had multiple enlightening conversations around how the intent of designers and data analysts/scientists are very different when they create visualizations. Whereas a 'data person' wants to optimize the speed at which the audience can make an informed decision, a designer wants the audience to spend some time interacting with the visualization.",
			"This unique ability to move between these worlds makes KL an ideal member of a design team, a data team, or — better yet — a blended team."
